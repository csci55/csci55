This is basic illustration of Elevator Class for first Assignment as per the specs laid out by Harvard University Spring 2016 CSCI 55 course.
The public methods are move() and boardPassenger(int floor).
move() is public method to move the elevator one floor at a time.
boardPassenger(int floor) takes a passenger to a desired floor.
In order to create a constraint this class assumes a final constant as TOTAL_FLOORS, which for the assignment has been initialized to value 7.
There are two enums defined as MOVE_UP and MOVE_DOWN to control the direction of the movement. This is used to change the values of private variable called current_direction.
current_floor ranges 0 to 6 indicating range from floor #1 through #7.
destined_passengers array keeps tracks of how many passers are destined to each floor.
How to run:
